* Raycasting on LOD


* Add noise option to obscure tiling
http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/texturerepetition/texturerepetition.htm

Figure out why/how VT is tiling the terrain panels and why it prevents the above



* Ray casting on camera

* Use slope of ground to improve collision

* Add grass

* UI controls shadow performance, full screen, quit, stats, shader details

* Combine scenes into one
	- Create terrains with code
	- Move textures to one folder

* Implement firing add/destroy boxes

* Cave generation algorithm (yt)


* Rather than generating with opensimplexnoise, better to use existing GLSL code in a fragment shader?

Voronoi, worley, musgrave noise


Bugs:

* Can't load material from code for terrain
* Can't load LODterreain from code at all


Low priority:
* Sphinx documentation
